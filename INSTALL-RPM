INSTALLATION NOTES FOR RPM

This release of setools includes support for the creation of rpm packages
and installation from those packages. Dan Walsh <dwalsh@redhat.com>
provided the initial version of these rpms. This support
has only been tested on Red Hat 9.

BWIDGETS

BWidgets (which are required for setools - see INSTALL for more
information) are not available as rpms from RedHat, so BWidgets rpms
are included.

RPM CREATION

After untarring the release of setools both the setools and BWidgets
rpms can be created by typing "make rpm" in the top level setools
directory. The rpms will be created by default under
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS and /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS (for the source
rpms). You must have a full SELinux installation in order to compile
these rpms.

RPM INSTALLATION

In order to install the setools rpm you must have the checkpolicy,
policycoreutils, policy, and policy-sources rpms from the SELinux
distributions installed. See the SELinux documentation for more
information about creating these rpms. After installing the SELinux
rpms the setools and BWidget rpms can be installed with the commands:

rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/BWidget*.rpm
rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/setools-*.rpm
