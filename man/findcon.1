.TH findcon 1
.SH NAME
findcon \- SELinux file context search tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B findcon
[OPTIONS] -c CONTEXT FILENAMES
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B findcon
allows the user to search for files with a specified context.
Results can be filtered by object class as described below.
.PP 
A context may be specified as a colon separated list of user, role, and type as follows: user_u:object_r:type_t.
If your system supports MLS you can also add an additional MLS range to the end as follows: user_u:object_r:type_t:s0.
If a user is not specified then the query will match all users; likewise, empty role, type, and range fields match all.
If your system has MLS and the translation library is enabled, matching is done using translated contexts.
If you want the tool to match raw contexts, please use the --raw option.
