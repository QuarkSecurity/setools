/**
 *  @file
 *  Public interface for computing semantic policy differences
 *  between two policies.  The user loads two policies, the "original"
 *  and "modified" policies, and then calls poldiff_create() to obtain
 *  a poldiff object.  Next call poldiff_run() to actually execute the
 *  differencing algorithm.  Results are retrieved via
 *  poldiff_get_type_vector(), poldiff_get_avrule_vector(), and so
 *  forth.
