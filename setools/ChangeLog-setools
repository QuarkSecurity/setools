========================================================
December 18, 2003 Version 1.1

Apol:	
	Significantly improved transitive information flow analysis
		by allowing for greater control over the types,
		object classes, and permissions to use in an analysis;
		as well as the ability to search for multiple paths
		bounded by number of founds paths and time.
		Additional work to complete a fully functional
		transitive flow analysis is planned.
	Updated to work with restructured libraries
	Added support for saving and loading analysis queries
	Additional work to make the fonts and window sizes work better

Secmds: NEW
	Added new command line tools:
		seinfo: displays information--including expanded
			information--about the components of a
			policy (classes, types, attributes, users,
			roles), as well as policy stats
		sesearch: searches and displays type enforcement
			rules based on criteria such as source
			and target type, object class, permissions,
			and rule type

seaudit: NEW 
	 Added a new GUI-based audit log analysis tool.  The tool allows
	 	one to view and search SE Linux messages from a log file
	 	and to analyze the policy for rules that relate to 
	 	a given audit message.  This is a first generation tool,
	 	and real-time monitoring of the audit messages is planned.

libseaudit: NEW 
	    Includes library to parse and store SE Linux audit messages.

Libapol:
	Added latent support to parse future conditional policy syntax
	Restructured library to separate core functions from 
		TCL/TK/X support functions (to allow non-X commands).

	Improved transitive information flow analysis.
	
Libseuser:
	Restructured library to separate core functions from TCL/TK/X 
		support functions (to allow non-X commands). There are
		now libseuser and libseuser-tcl libraries.
