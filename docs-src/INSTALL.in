BUILDING AND INSTALLING NOTES AND WARNINGS

If you are upgrading from a previous version of setools you must make 
sure you remove /usr/local/selinux/bin from your path.  The setools 
set is now installed to /usr/bin to match the rest of SE Linux.

We have built and used this package on Linux (Red Hat 7.x and Red Hat 
9.x) using several versions of SELinux.  The tar file will create a 
directory with the following subdirectories:

apol            The policy analysis tool
awish           Our customized version of the Tk wish interpreter
libapol         The main policy (policy.conf) analysis library
libseaudit	The seaudit support library 
libseuser       The seuser support library	
seaudit 	The audit log analysis tool (seaudit)
secmds		The setools command line tools (seinfo and sesearch)
sepct           The policy configuration/editing tool (sepcut)
seuser          The user management tool and shell scripts
packages	External packages required by setools
	

TCL/TK VERSION AND INSTALL :Before building you will need to ensure 
that you have Tcl/Tk 8.3 or higher installed with BWidgets. 
Generally, Red Hat Linux has appropriate versions of Tcl and Tk. 
Usually the BWidgets package IS NOT installed by default. If you do 
not have BWidgets installed it is available in the packages 
subdirectory. It can be installed by going to the packages 
subdirectory and typing "make install". If you have BWidgets installed 
make certain that it is a compatible version. See BWIDGETS VERSIONS 
below for more information.

GTK RUNTIME AND BUILD REQUIREMENT: In order to successfully install 
seaudit onto your system you will need libglade and GTK2.0 or above 
installed.  It also requires the pkg-config program to be installed 
before you can build.

Given that you have Tcl/Tk with BWidgets installed, below are the 
build instructions.  You can build and install portions of the package 
including only those tools and libraries that do not require a GUI and 
X support.  See "make help" for a list of all build targets.

NOTE: If you're using MLS aspects of a policy, apol and the other 
tools are specifically not currently designed to address those 
aspects. However, you may have success using apol with MLS-enabled 
policies if you compile with the -DCONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_MLS flag in 
the Makefile. We have conducted very little testing with MLS enabled. 
Even with this flag set during compile time, apol still ignores all 
the MLS aspects of a policy, but should be able to parse such 
policies.

BUILDING AND INSTALL

Short version: make all; su root; make install  

Long version follows:

0. Review the ./setools/Makefile, and ensure that the TCL_INCLUDE and 
TCL_LIBINC variables are set appropriately for your installation of 
Tcl/Tk.
   
1. If you are installing seuser and have a version of SELinux based
on an LSM kernel earlier than 2.4.19 (prior to August 2002 or so): 

	a. Check that you have the policy management changes to your 
	installed policy. Starting with the 2.4.19 LSM kernel based 
	SELinux, you do NOT need to install the policy patch; skip 
	ahead to Step 2.

	The changes to the policy necessary for pre-2.4.19 LSM kernels 
	are based on a patch we posted for the SELinux main 
	distribution.  See ./setools/policy/polpatch/readme.txt for 
	further instructions on determining whether you need the patch 
	and if so how to apply it.

	b. After you have applied the patch for the policy, make sure 
	the policy sources are installed. The patched policy make 
	file (./selinux/policy/Makefile) should have an 
	"install-src" target that will do this for you.

2. Build and install tools:  If you want to install all tools, just 
type "make install" to build and install everything.  Type "make" to 
see options to build individual pieces, for example to install just 
seuser, sepcut, or apol.

NOTE: If you installed seuser ("make install" or "make install-
seuser"), then the makefile also attempted to install the seuser 
policy.  If this failed, you either are not using an SELinux machine, 
the policy management patch isn't installed (see Step 1), or the 
policy source directory is not installed in the conventional location 
(use make install-src in the policy source directory from the SELinux 
distribution). Email us; we'll try to help (selinux@tresys.com)!

Most errors result from improperly installed Tcl/Tk, BWidgets, or the 
above libapol files.

BWIDGETS VERSIONS

The BWidgets package can be found at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcllib. There are some 
incompatibilities with different versions of Tcl/Tk and BWidgets that 
can cause critical runtime errors. You will not be able to run any of 
the tools if you are using incompatible versions of Tcl/Tk and 
BWidgets. Correct versions of BWidgets for the Tcl/Tk version you are 
using are:

	- Tcl/Tk 8.3 - BWidget-1.4.1
	- Tcl/Tk 8.4 or greater - any

NOTE: You may run the tools using a pre-1.4.1 BWidgets package, 
however, you may experience problems. These tools have been tested 
using BWidgets 1.4.1 and 1.6.0. See TESTING INFORMATION in KNOWN-BUGS for
more  information on what platforms and configurations these tools have
been tested against.

Once you  have downloaded the correct version of BWidgets, then you 
can install it in your TCL directory. For instance, if you have 
Tcl installed in the /usr/lib directory, then you should install the 
BWidgets directory to /usr/lib/tcl8.3/.
