<h1>Understanding types relationship summary analysis</h1>

<p>
The types relationship summary analysis in apol is a convenience
mechanism to allow a user to quickly do several queries and analyses
already in present in apol to understand the relationship between two
types.  It is meant to quickly display the relationship between two
types and therefore does not include all of the options present in the
standard queries and analyses.  The analyses are grouped into two
categories: <em>Basic</em> and <em>Analysis</em>.
