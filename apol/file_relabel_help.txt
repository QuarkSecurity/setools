UNDERSTANDING FILE RELABEL ANALYSIS

The permission to relabel a file has elevated significance in a type enforcement 
system.  The ability to change type leads to the possibility of circumventing 
the control provided by the type enforcement policy.  Therefore it is useful 
to be able to analyze the ability to relabel both from the standpoint of policy 
development, deciding to what extent to permit relabeling, and that of system 
administration, detecting potential vulnerabilities from less obvious access or 
unwanted information flows. Several cases exist for the use of this type of 
analysis as enumerated below (It should be noted that the cases presented are 
not intended to be an exhaustive list):

Case 1:
The first case is the simplest and most common search desired - given a starting
type, in a single step, to what types can it be relabeled in which domains.  

Case 2:
The second case involves searching from a given end type for a list of types 
from which it could be relabeled in a single step. 

Case 3:
The third case is a single domain search for all possible start and end types 
that a given domain can relabel. 

Case 4:
Another case that arises in analyzing the relabeling permissions of a policy 
is whether there exists the ability to relabel a file to and/or from one type to
another type associated with a particular object class. This is essentially a 
filtering of case 1, 2 and 3. 

USING THE DIRECT FILE RELABEL ANALYSIS INTERFACE IN APOL

File relabel analysis in apol is designed to facilitate querying an SELinux 
policy for the possible changes for any given type provided by the special
permissions 'relabelto' and 'relabelfrom'. There are two modes for a query:

	- Object mode - must indicate the direction of the relabeling (i.e.
			To, From, or Both)
	- Subject mode
	
In Object mode, the analysis examines relabeling from the perspective of an 
object entity, which does not initiate the relabeling action, but rather is
subjected to being relabeled. In this mode, the direction of the relabeling
can be further controlled for the analysis. The directions are To, From, or
Both. So for example, using this analysis, one can choose to determine all 
types 'to' which relabeling is possible, given a starting type. Additionally, 
one can choose to determine all types 'from' which relabeling is possible, 
given an ending type or find all types 'to' or 'from' which relabeling is 
possible (both).

In Subject mode, the analysis examines relabeling from the perspective of the 
subject entity, which actually initiates the relabeling. So for example, one
can determine all types 'to' and 'from' which that subject can relabel.

The interface provides the user with radio buttons for selecting the desired
mode for the query. Upon selecting Object mode, two checkboxes will become 
enabled for specifying the direction of the relabeling to the query. By default, 
the direction is set to Both, which is indicated by both checkboxes being 
selected. Also, upon selecting the checkboxes, the labels within the 'Required
parameters' frame will change accordingly. 

Within the 'Required parameters' frame are checkboxes, the top-most of which is 
for specifying the starting/ending type to the query. The checkbox below is only 
used to filter the list of types from which to choose in the starting/ending type 
checkbox and has no affect on the query.

Within the 'Optional result filters' frame are options for filtering the results
of the query by end type using a regular expression and/or filtering the results
based upion the object class of the ending type. The ability to filter types given 
a desired set of permissions would also be useful, however, this will be available 
in the near future. Note, that the list of object classes provided does not 
necessarily include all of the object classes defined in the policy, as this list
has been filtered to include only object classes which have the 'relabelto' and
'relabelfrom' permission.

UNDERSTANDING THE RESULTS OF A DIRECT FILE RELABEL ANALYSIS

The results of the query are represented by a tree with the given starting/ending
type as the parent node of the tree. However, the child nodes of the tree are
represented differently based upon the specified mode of the query. 

If the user has specified Object mode, the child nodes will consist of all of the 
ending types included within the results. Selecting a child node from the tree, 
will display the subjects that can relabel the given starting/ending type to or 
from the selected ending type, along with the rule proof and if a policy source 
file is loaded, hyperlinked line numbers to the policy.conf tab.  Selecting the 
parent node of the tree when in Object mode will display a brief summary of the 
number of ending types found and some simple instructions. 

If the user has specified Subject mode, the tree will contain only two child nodes, 
labeled 'To' and 'From' respectively. Each of these nodes may contain a subtree of 
end types representing the types to and from which the specified domain can relabel. 
The user may choose to expand the subtrees to view the returned list of ending types. 
Selecting an end type from one of these subtrees, will display information indicating 
that the starting/ending type can relabel to or from (depending on which subtree is 
selected) the selected domain type, along with the rule proof and if a policy source 
file is loaded, hyperlinked line numbers to the policy.conf tab. Also, selecting the 
parent node of the tree when in Subject mode will display a brief summary and some 
simple instructions.
