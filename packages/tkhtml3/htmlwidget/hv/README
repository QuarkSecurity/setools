OBJECTS
-------

Hv3 Mega-Widget Object Types:

  Widgets:

    ::hv3::hv3                   (hv3.tcl)
        Reusable mega-widget built on top of Tkhtml. There is no man-page
        yet, but the widget interface is described at the top of the
        file hv3.tcl.

    
    ::hv3::tclet                 (hv3_object.tcl)
        A widget containing a Tcl applet running in a safe interpreter.
        Widget's of this type are used as replacement objects for Tkhtml
        nodes whenever a Tclet specified as an <object> or <embed> tag
        is encountered.
    
    ::hv3::control               (hv3_form.tcl)
        A widget class for form controls. This is used as the replacement
        object for <input>, <select>, <textarea>, <isindex> and <button>
        element nodes.

    ::hv3::fileselect            (hv3_form.tcl)
        Used (and encapsulated) by ::hv3::control to implement
        <input type=file> controls.
 
    ::hv3::filedownloader        (hv3_http.tcl)
        This widget implements the file-downloading dialog (i.e. the thing
        with the progress bar and Ok/Cancel button).

    ::hv3::findwidget            (hv3_widgets.tcl)
        This widget implements logic and gui for the "find text" function. It
        currently uses Tkhtml3 interfaces only (no hv3 interfaces).  
        NOTE: This will have to change to support frameset documents.

  Other Types:

    ::hv3::hv3::selectionmanager (hv3.tcl)
    ::hv3::hv3::dynamicmanager   (hv3.tcl)
    ::hv3::hv3::hyperlinkmanager (hv3.tcl)
        Internal components to manage the selection, dynamic (i.e. :hover)
        effects and hyperlinks, respectively. These are really just used
        to break up the hv3::hv3 a bit. Eventually, each of these (and the
        formmanager) will be optional functions that may be enabled or 
        disabled by hv3 users. TODO: Images too? Should there be an 
        ::hv3::hv3::imagemanager?

    ::hv3::formmanager           (hv3_form.tcl)
    ::hv3::form                  (hv3_form.tcl)

    ::hv3::download              (hv3.tcl)

    ::hv3::uri                   (hv3.tcl)
        Type to extract components from and perform other operations on URIs.

Hv3 Protocol Object Types:

  Other Types:

    ::hv3::protocol              (hv3_http.tcl)
    ::hv3::cookiemanager         (hv3_http.tcl)

Hv3 Application Object Types:

  Widgets:

    ::hv3::frameset              (hv3_frameset.tcl)

    ::hv3::browser_frame         (hv3_main.tcl)

    ::hv3::browser (hv3_main.tcl)
         Instances of this widget are managed directly by the notebook.
         Each instance of this widget creates it's own ::hv3::protocol
         and ::hv3::history objects. It also creates and destroys
         ::hv3::findwidget widgets as requested by the user.

    ::hv3::finddialog            (hv3_widgets.tcl)
        This widget implements the find-text dialog.

  Other Types:

    ::hv3::history               (hv3_main.tcl)

NOTES ON FRAMES AND TABS
------------------------

  Both frames and tabs are implemented as part of the demo application, not
  Tkhtml or the hv3 mega-widget.
